# ⚠️ Disclaimer: CC-UI Framework is Under Development and Not Ready for Use ⚠️

Thank you for your interest in CC-UI! Please be aware that CC-UI is currently in its early stages of development and is not yet suitable for use in production environments or live servers. The framework is actively being worked on, and numerous features and optimizations are yet to be implemented.

Key Points to Note:

- **Work in Progress:** CC-UI is a work in progress, and many components and functionalities are not fully functional or tested.
- **Bugs and Issues:** Expect the presence of bugs, unexpected behavior, and potential issues while using CC-UI in its current state.
- **Incomplete Documentation:** Documentation might be limited or missing, making it challenging to understand certain aspects of the framework.
- **No Guarantee of Stability:** As an under-development project, CC-UI is not guaranteed to be stable, and updates may introduce breaking changes.

**Contribution and Feedback:**
While we discourage the use of CC-UI in live environments, we appreciate any contributions and feedback from the community. Feel free to report issues, suggest improvements, or contribute to the development of CC-UI to help us shape it into a reliable and feature-rich UI framework for FiveM.

Stay Tuned for Updates:
Please stay tuned for future updates as we progress with the development of CC-UI. We will announce its readiness for usage when it becomes more stable and feature-complete.

Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to your support in shaping CC-UI into a robust and user-friendly framework for FiveM.
